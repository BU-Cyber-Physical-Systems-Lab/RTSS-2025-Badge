# UNO R3
This is an adaptation of the original board design from [a port of Arduino board designs for KiCad](https://github.com/sabogalc/KiCad-Arduino-Boards) which features a USB-C connection port.
Only silkscreen layers and the size of the board have been modified to
fit the conference logo and information.

The original README and board files are available [here](https://github.com/sabogalc/KiCad-Arduino-Boards/tree/main/KiCad%20Projects/Uno/Arduino%20Uno).
